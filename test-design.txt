;; PROTEAN TEST DESIGN
;;
;; test documents may be migrated to datomic at a later date for now edn definitions

;; Testing API
; mixing service/path combinations and providing seed data
{
  :host "localhost"
  :port 9000
  :auth {:basic {:token "TOKEN"}}
  :locs #{"s1 p1" "s2 p1 p2 p3" "s3"}
  :seed #{"agents/1"}
}

;; Testing API
; specifying services and providing seed data
{
  :host "localhost"
  :port 9000
  :auth {:basic {:token "TOKEN"}}
  :locs #{"s1" "s2"}
  :seed #{"agents/1"}
}

;; Testing API
; testing all services providing seed data
{
  :host "localhost"
  :port 9000
  :auth {:basic {:token "TOKEN"}}
  :seed #{"agents/1"}
}

;; Testing SIM
; testing service/path combinations
{:locs #{"s1 p1" "s2 p1 p2"}}

;; Testing SIM
; testing services
{:locs #{"s1" "s2"}}

;; Testing SIM
; testing all
{}

;; Testing notes
; testing works across two routes, SIM and API
; the shape of the test doc determines the route
; both range acoss svc/path sequences in the same way
; API testing:
;    - concerns itself with authzn/authcn
;    - calls svc/path items when it can stitch data in from the seed
;    - aggregates results back into the seed to unlock further svc/path items
